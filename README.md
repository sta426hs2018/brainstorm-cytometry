## **Overview Flow Cytometry**
- cell type and cell count discovery; enables cell sorting
- cells labeled with fluorescent antibodies are brought into a single cell suspension, which is illuminated with a laser light beam: cellular features produce light scatter (forward angle scatter and side angle scatter)
- different cell types produce forward scatter and side scatter to a different extent
- output: two-parameter plots and single-parameter histograms

## **Overview Mass Cytometry**

- combination of plasma mass spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry
- cellular proteins labeled with isotope-conjugated antibodies, metal signals analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometer





## **Comparison between the two techniques**

FC is cheaper and faster, but needs compensation for fluorescence overlap.

MC is able to detect more parameters per cell than FC, but requires more sample preparation.
